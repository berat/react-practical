# react-practical

After learning React, I made a twitter-style project to reinforce what I learned. Actually, the aim of the project is to share the problems you encounter when you work, how they find solutions.

When developing the project, I created an npm package and shared it as open source. To reach the repo: [Pagination React Hooks](https://github.com/berat/pagination-react-hooks)

To run the project on your computer: 

1- `npm start`
